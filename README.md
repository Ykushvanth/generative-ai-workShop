#generative ai workshop
This Python program creates a chatbot using LangChain, OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model, and Gradio. The chatbot responds to user queries by maintaining a conversation history for context. The program sets up a prompt template and uses a conversation buffer to provide contextually aware responses. Gradio is used to create a user-friendly chat interface. The chatbot can be launched locally and made publicly accessible if needed.

Key Features:
LangChain: Manages the language model and conversation flow.
OpenAI: Utilizes GPT-3.5-turbo for generating responses.
Gradio: Provides an interactive web-based chat interface.
Prompt Template: Structures conversation prompts.
Memory Buffer: Maintains chat history for context.
